# Code I'm proud of

## Writing my own Middleware
For this project, I wrote my own middleware functions check if a user is logged in in order to access certain routes.  By breaking this functionality out into a seperate reusable middleare function, I am able to quickly protect routes and reuse this function as the app grows.  I used PassportJS for auth, which comes with many handy functions for checking user data.

## EJS Practice
Although now a days I prefer building with React/Redux, this project gave me a lot of great experience building wiht the EJS templating language, which I also greatly enjoy!
